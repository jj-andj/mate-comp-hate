# Analysis on Hate Crime & Mate Competition 

## Overview

This repo features a reproduction of Rafaela Dancygier, Naoki Egami, Amaney Jamal, and Ramona Rischke's paper, [**`Hate Crimes and Gender Imbalances: Fears over Mate Competition and Violence against Refugees`**](https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12595), containing `R` scripts and a final `PDF` report ([link here](https://github.com/jj-andj/mate-comp-hate/blob/main/outputs/paper/paper.pdf)). This analysis furthered the original paper's discussion of the concerning correlation of perceived mate competition contributing to anti-refugee sentiments and higher hate crime rates with Canadian lens, and concludes in recommending that competition-based justification for such hate should be considered and addressed at a high level.

A replication using the Social Science Reproduction Platform was also produced: [link here](https://www.socialsciencereproduction.org/reproductions/994/published/index?step=1#:~:text=https%3A//doi.org/10.48152/ssrp%2Dqg85%2Dcb34)
