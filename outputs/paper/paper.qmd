    abstract: "Globalization, immigration, and asylum seeking is a common topic of discussion, one which most people hold some personal opinion on accompanied by certain justifications. This paper analyzes data on what proportion of non-immigrant German men are likely to perceive refugees as threats to finding a romantic partner relative to the male-to-female ratio within their municipality and which of them support sentiments of anti-refugee violence. Results show that there can be argued an effect of these sentiments on actual rates of hate crime. We apply secondary research regarding Canadian rates of immigration and gender imbalances and raise concerns regarding the possibly generalizable nature of the findings in Germany. As this issue specifically affects minority groups experiencing prejudice and even furthers their marginalization, we place great emphasis on the weight of this discussion and propose that it should be considered to inform policies or initiatives intending to address racism and hate crimes, especially in breaking down the framing of refugees as a threat to non-immigrants, whether that's through education, public messaging, or other implementations."

# Introduction

In Canada, hate crimes based on race and ethnicity increased by 80% in 2020, with the highest number of incidents targeting black individuals, followed by east and southeast Asians, indigenous individuals, and the lowest number of victims being South Asian individuals [@moreau_wang_2022]. Seeing that Canada is one of the most diverse countries in the world, welcoming 405,999 permanent immigrants in 2021 and 130,125 refugees in 2020, these statistics concerning the increase of hate crimes pose a real and visceral threat to a large proportion of Canadian residents [@government_of_canada_2022].

There are many factors that contribute to the increase in hate crimes in Canada. However, with the rise of far-right discourse in the United States, anti-immigrant and anti-refugee rhetoric is becoming more prevalent in Canada. These negative attitudes and actions towards immigrants, refugees, and marginalized individuals can be the result of various structural and personal factors, including increased competition in the job and housing markets, resource scarcity, misguided beliefs about crime rates, illness, welfare dependency, and fears of losing national identity. Despite this, one factor that has received little attention until recently is the impact of competition in dating and marriage markets. A 2021 paper by Dancygier, Egami, Jamal, and Rischke published in the American Journal of Political Science delves into this important and often-overlooked area of research [@main_paper].

In studying the opinions of German males living in municipalities with excess male populations, they find that a portion of non-immigrant German men hold the belief that refugees pose a threat to their ability to pursue German women [@main_paper]. Their findings for the estimand of non-immigrant German men suggest that hate crimes increase where non-immigrant German men are disadvantaged in their local dating markets [@main_paper]. By using ecological evidence and originally curated survey data, the paper concludes that competition in dating and marriage markets where men outnumber women increase anti-refugee sentiments and violence [@main_paper].

Our paper will follow a reproduction of Dancygier, Egami, Jamal, and Rischke's findings and apply a Canadian facing lens to discuss its implications on local Canadian populations and increased anti-refugee/ immigrant sentiments and violence. In addressing the following two research claims, (1) Non-immigrant German men who live in municipalities with excess male populations are more likely to perceive refugees as threats and (2) Non-immigrant German men who perceive mate competition are more likely to support violence as the only means to gain the attention of German politicians, we conclude that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_INSERT CONCLUSION HERE\_\_\_\_\_.

# Data 
## Source
The paper used for replication is from the American Journal of Political Science which follows a discussion on the correlation of perceived mate competition and its contributions to anti-refugee sentiments and higher crime rates in Germany (cite paper). Our reproduction seeks to address two claims made from the original paper and apply a Canadian facing lens. The two claims are as follows: 
(1) Are non-immigrant German men who live in municipalities with excess male populations more likely to perceive refugees as threats?
(2) Are non-immigrant German men who perceive mate competition more likely to support violence as the only means to gain the attention of German politicians?
To collect this data, the original paper uses four waves of online survey data collected in Germany that are representative of gender, age and state (geographic location) [@main_paper]. 

## Methodology 
This paper will replicate the survey data that was originally collected for the 2021 paper by Dancygier, Egami, Jamal, and Rischkes, as previously mentioned. Using the online survey platform “Respondi”, they conduct four waves of surveys which spanned from September 2016 to December 2017 [@main_paper]. The researchers suggest that the anonymity provided by the online survey platform resulted in respondents answering more truthfully. [@main_paper]. To mitigate potential biases, the researchers employed list experiments in Waves 1 and 2, and in Wave 2, they randomly assigned 50% of the sample to either a control or treatment group. The treatment group was exposed to statements concerning their agreement with using violence against refugees as a means to get the attention of German politicians. However, no evidence was found to suggest that respondents were concealing their support for hate crimes when comparing the means of the control and treatment groups [@main_paper].

## Ethical Implications

In their paper, Dancygier, Egami, Jamal, and Rischke examine the ethical implication of using experimental methodologies to investigate their research topic. By using descriptive data in the form of surveys they are able to investigate the opinions of non-immigrant German males and their perception of mate competition and its translation to anti-refugee violence. By avoiding experimental trials, they were able to explore their topic without provoking anti-refugee sentiment, which might have been a possible outcome had trials been conducted [@main_paper]. While conducting experimental trials on this topic of research is considered unethical, surveys and questionnaires may have a tendency to give respondents the impression that their opinions are commonly shared or even accurate. By being presented with a platform to express their perception of mate competition and if they agree that violence towards refugees is the only way to garner the attention of German politicians, respondents may feel that their opinions are incorrectly justified. This then has the potential to translate to violence towards German refugees.

## Accounting for Bias

Ethical implications and biases arise naturally when collecting quantitative and qualitative data. In their paper, Dancygier, Egami, Jamal, and Rischke use online survey platforms to assess if Germans living in areas with greater populations of men who experience turmoil in the mating market are more likely to perceive competition between themselves and refugees, moreover, does this ideology predict hate crime support [@main_paper]. The authors attempted to address ethical concerns and statistical biases by utilizing control groups and replicating their study with different samples and polling firms. However, one potential bias that is challenging to control for is the presence of sampling bias [@main_paper]. Sampling bias occurs when participants in a study are not representative of the estimand or the ideal population of interest. One method to control for this bias is simple random sampling, where participants are chosen by chance. Meaning that every individual in the population/ estimand has an equal chance of being selected. However, in their study, they were unable to utilize simple random sampling. Instead attempted to make their survey results representative by conducting four waves of surveys meant to be representative of age, gender and state/ geographical region [@main_paper}. Despite their effort, their survey results may not be entirely representative as individuals who have a strong interest in the subject matter are more likely to participate, meaning they do not reflect the views of all non-immigrant German males [@main_paper].
